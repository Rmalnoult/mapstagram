Locate Precisely Instagram pics on a google map !

This program allows you to search for instagram pics using the instagram api.
It displays 30 pictures and extracts the geoloc informations (longitude & latitude).
Using these informations, every pic becomes a marker precisely geolocated on a map (powered by google map api v3)

I'd like to add other social network posts on this map but none seem to offer the geolocation information like instagram.


suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
